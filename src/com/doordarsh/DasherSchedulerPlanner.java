/*

You're a dasher, and you want to try planning out your schedule. You can view a list of deliveries along with their associated start time, end time, 
and dollar amount for completing the order. Assuming dashers can only deliver one order at a time, determine the maximum amount of money you can make 
from the given deliveries.

The inputs are as follows:

int start_time: when you plan to start your schedule
int end_time: when you plan to end your schedule
int d_starts[n]: the start times of each delivery[i]
int d_ends[n]: the end times of each delivery[i]
int d_pays[n]: the pay for each delivery[i]
The output should be an integer representing the maximum amount of money you can make by forming a schedule with the given deliveries.

Constraints
end_time >= start_time
d_ends[i] >= d_starts[i]
d_pays[i] > 0
len(d_starts) == len(d_ends) == len(d_pays)

Example
dict(
    start_time = 0,
    end_time = 10,
    d_starts = [2, 3, 5, 7],
    d_ends = [6, 5, 10, 11],
    d_pays = [5, 2, 4, 1],
    expect = 6,
)
